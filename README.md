## Face Generation - CelebA Dataset

In this project, we try to train a GAN for face generation from mnist and celebA dataset.This project was done as part of Neural Network Foundations Nanodegree program at Udacity. 

The Jupyter notebook with final GAN model can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Face-Generation/blob/master/face_generation.ipynb).
